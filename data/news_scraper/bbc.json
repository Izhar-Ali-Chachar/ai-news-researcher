        "title": "'Pea allergy almost killed my boy. It's only right to add it to food labels'",
        "text": "One morning before school, Rex, aged nine, ate a hot cross bun. Minutes later, he was struggling to breathe and went into anaphylactic shock. Rex is allergic is to peas and lentils - ingredients you would not commonly expect to find in a hot cross bun. However, when Rex's mum looked at the packaging, it turned out the glazing used on the bun contained pea protein - causing Rex's allergic reaction. Pea is not one of the 14 allergens required by law to be listed on food labels but , experts said it – among others – should be. Rex's father, Tom, says it \"feels like a lot of these things are booby-trapped\". \"We couldn't understand why,\" he says. \"It wasn't a vegan recipe. What is pea protein doing in a hot cross bun?\" After he went into anaphylactic shock, Rex was quickly given his EpiPen and taken to hospital. He made a full recovery but hot cross buns aren't the only unassuming product he's been tripped up by. During June's heatwave, Rex bought an ice cream after school from a corner shop. As he'd eaten this particular brand before, he didn't check the packaging but, unbeknownst to him, the ice cream now contained pea protein and caused another allergic reaction. Tom says Rex is now \"terrified\" of accidentally eating pea and having an allergic reaction. He agrees with experts that the list of 14 allergens should be expanded to include pea and feels \"frustrated\" it is being increasingly added to foods. Under current regulations, food packaging in the UK and EU already lists the most common allergens for people to be aware of, such as egg, peanuts and sesame. They must be clearly emphasised, usually in bold, on labels while restaurants will either list allergens on menus or inform customers verbally. Rex isn't the only child being caught out by pea protein in products. In 2023, Becky gave her son an ice lolly he'd eaten before with no issues. However, the now-five year-old quickly began coughing while his throat became irritated. The lolly contained pea protein – which her son, like Rex, is severely allergic too. For Becky and her husband, expanding the allergens list to include clear warnings for peas would be \"life-changing\" and a \"massive weight\" off their minds. \"It's getting harder and harder to say 'well, it probably doesn't contain pea' because pea is in things that you would never think it would be,\" she added. \"It's like playing a game of roulette.\" Although it's becoming more common, people with a pea allergy are finding it's not taken as seriously as other allergies. Charlotte, 25, is allergic to all pulses - including peas, chickpeas and lentils. She would welcome expanding the allergen list as it would make people more aware of her allergies as she's frequently told it's \"not a real allergy\". \"I think because it's kind of like a joke that people don't like peas, people think that I'm just being fussy,\" she says. \"People just don't consider it a real allergy or even understand what it is.\" Charlotte says this can make eating out quite hard. Two weeks ago she went out for dinner in London and had an allergic reaction but staff insisted her food wasn't contaminated. \"I ended up apologising that I was having allergic reaction because I felt so embarrassed I was making an inconvenience for them.\" Becky also says her son has had similar experiences. He's allergic to egg, peanuts, nuts, sesame, chickpeas, peas and lentils but his  reaction to pea is seen very differently - even though it's as severe, if not worse than his reaction to peanuts. It's not just pea allergies that are becoming more common. Experts also suggested that allergic reaction warning labels should be added to foods containing pine nuts, buckwheat and sheep and goat's milk. Annabel, 20, has just completed a degree at the University of Cambridge. She's allergic to pine nuts and believes adding them to the list of allergens could potentially be \"life saving\" for her. Like Charlotte, Annabel finds communicating her allergies to restaurant staff can be very hit or miss. \"I often feel like my allergy is not taken seriously,\" she says. \"When I state an allergy to pine nuts, the vast majority of the time they reply 'peanuts?'\" She says staff often tells her there's no nuts in her food but thinks they just mean the nuts which are recognised as part of the 14 allergens. She's had three anaphylactic reactions, including when she was informed by restaurants that her meal didn't contain pine nuts. Annabel says adding it to the list would make her feel \"so much more confident\" when eating out. \"A lot of my family like to eat out quite a lot and I often don't want to go, or when I'm with my friends I'm always telling everyone around me 'this is where my EpiPens are, this is what to do if something happens', [so] to have that safety and to not worry would be such a big difference to me.\" The Food Standards Agency said earlier it recognised there were a significant number of foods that could cause allergies or intolerances. While Allergy UK said it was calling for full ingredient labelling on all food products while keeping an eye on worrying trends."

        "title": "'Two laptops, six plugs': The South Korean cafes grappling with students who don't leave",
        "text": "In the affluent Seoul neighbourhood of Daechi, Hyun Sung-joo has a dilemma. His coffee shop is sometimes visited by Cagongjok, a term for mostly young South Koreans who love to study or work at cafes, but there's a limit. He says one customer recently set up a workspace in his cafe that included two laptops and a six-port power strip to charge all their devices - for an entire day. \"I ended up blocking off the power outlets,\" he tells the BBC. \"With Daechi's high rents, it's difficult to run a cafe if someone occupies a seat all day.\" The cultural phenomenon of Cagongjok is rampant in South Korea, especially in areas with large numbers of students and office workers. They dominate cafes often on a much greater scale than other Western countries like the UK, where those studying are often surrounded by others there to socialise. And Starbucks Korea warned this month that a , such as bringing in desktop monitors, printers, partitioning off desks or leaving tables unattended for long periods. The chain has now launched nationwide guidelines aimed at curbing \"a small number of extreme cases\" where elaborate setups or prolonged empty seats disrupt other customers. Starbucks said staff would not ask customers to leave, but rather provide \"guidance\" when needed. It also cited previous cases of theft when customers left belongings unattended, calling the new guidelines \"a step toward a more comfortable store environment\". It doesn't seem to be deterring the more moderate Cagongjok though, for whom Starbucks has been somewhat of a haven in recent years and continues to be. On a Thursday evening in Seoul's Gangnam district, a Starbucks branch buzzes quietly with customers studying, heads down over laptops and books. Among them is an 18-year-old student who dropped out of school and is preparing for the university entrance exam, \"Suneung\". \"I get here around 11am and stay until 10pm,\" she tells the BBC. \"Sometimes I leave my things and go eat nearby.\" We have seen no bulky equipment during our visits to Starbucks since the new guidelines were issued on 7 August, though we did see one man with a laptop stand, keyboard and mouse. Some customers still appear to be leaving their seats unattended for long periods, with laptops and books spread across tables. When asked whether its new restrictions have led to visible changes, Starbucks Korea told the BBC it was \"difficult to confirm\". Reactions to Starbucks' move have been mixed. Most welcome the policy as a long-overdue step toward restoring normalcy in how cafes are used. This is particularly so among those who visit Starbucks for relaxation or conversation, who say it has become difficult to find seats because of Cagongjok, and that the hushed atmosphere often made them feel self-conscious about talking freely. A few have criticised it as overreach, saying the chain has abandoned its previously hands-off approach. It reflects a wider public discussion in South Korea over Cagongjok that has been brewing ever since it started taking off in 2010, coinciding with the growth of franchised coffee chains in the country. That has kept growing, with the country seeing a 48% increase in coffee shops over the past five years, according to the National Tax Service, nearing 100,000. Some 70% of people in a recent survey of more than 2,000 Gen Z job seekers in South Korea by recruitment platform Jinhaksa Catch said they studied in cafes at least once a week. Dealing with \"seat hogging\" and related issues is a tricky balance, and the independent cafes grappling with a similar thing have deployed a range of approaches. While Hyun has experienced customers bringing multiple electronic devices and setting up workstations, he says extreme cases like this are rare. \"It's maybe two or three people out of a hundred,\" the cafe owner of 15 years says. \"Most people are considerate. Some even order another drink if they stay long, and I'm totally fine with that.\" Hyun's cafe, which locals also use as a space for conversation or private tutoring, still welcomes Cagongjok as long as they respect the shared space. Some other cafe franchises even cater to them with power outlets, individual desks and longer stay allowances. But others have taken stricter steps. Kim, a cafe owner in Jeonju who asked the BBC to remain anonymous, introduced a \"No Study Zone\" policy after repeated complaints about space being monopolised. \"Two people would come in and take over space for 10. Sometimes they'd leave for meals and come back to study for seven or eight hours,\" he says. \"We eventually put up a sign saying this is a space for conversation, not for studying.\" Now his cafe allows a maximum of two hours for those using it to study or work. The rule does not apply to regular customers who are simply having coffee. \"I made the policy to prevent potential conflicts between customers,\" Kim says. So what's behind the trend and why do so many in South Korea feel the need to work or study in cafes rather than in libraries, shared workspaces or at home? For some, the cafe is more than just an ambient space; it's a place to feel grounded. Yu-jin Mo, 29, tells the BBC about her experience growing up in foster care. \"Home wasn't a safe place. I lived with my father in a small container, and sometimes he'd lock the door from the outside and leave me alone inside.\" Even now, as an adult, she finds it hard to be alone. \"As soon as I wake up, I go to a cafe. I tried libraries and study cafes, but they felt suffocating,\" she says. Later Ms Mo even ran her own cafe for a year, hoping to offer a space where people like her could feel comfortable staying and studying. Professor Choi Ra-young of Ansan University, who has studied lifelong education for over two decades, sees Cagongjok as a cultural phenomenon shaped by South Korea's hyper-competitive society. \"This is a youth culture created by the society we've built,\" she tells the BBC. \"Most Cagongjok are likely job seekers or students. They're under pressure - whether it's from academics, job insecurity or housing conditions with no windows and no space to study. \"In a way, these young people are victims of a system that doesn't provide enough public space for them to work or learn,\" she adds. \"They might be seen as a nuisance, but they're also a product of social structure.\" Professor Choi said it was time to create more inclusive spaces. \"We need guidelines and environments that allow for cafe studying - without disturbing others - if we want to accommodate this culture realistically.\""

        "title": "Anime fans hate live-action remakes - here's why studios still keep making them",
        "text": "When Netflix plans for a live-action remake of a beloved anime series, it was met with doubtful and even divided fans. Solo Leveling - which charts a lowly monster hunter's rise to power - is a classic tale of the triumph of an underdog. Originally a hit Korean web novel from 2016, its popularity surged globally after it was made into an anime series eight years later. Fans love it but that has only made them sceptical of a live-action adaptation. \"I have never had a great experience with live-action  and I do not see a future or need for them to exist,\" says Swedish fan Andre Denisson. Anime has captured imaginations for decades now, but the art, and its fans, have always seemed beyond the reach of mainstream film studios. Hollywood has struggled to pull off live-action remakes, and yet its successor - on-demand streaming - is keen to cash in on the genre. Why has it proved so hard to bring anime alive on the screen? Live-action remakes are a \"hit or miss\", says Ander Guerrero, an anime fan based in Spain. He is concerned that the CGI for Solo Leveling will not be able to do justice to the source material: \"The anime looks incredible mainly because of the fight sequences, which could be hard to replicate in live-action.\" There are plenty of such moments in Solo Leveling, which is set in a world where mankind's survival depends on \"hunters\" - humans with special abilities - battling and defeating magical monsters that appear through mysterious portals, or \"gates\". Monster hunters' abilities are pre-determined and cannot change. When we meet the main character, Sung Jin-woo, he is mankind's \"weakest weapon\" - but after a near-death experience, he becomes the only one with the ability to \"level up\" his abilities. The story, and the rich sequences it portrayed, even unseated fan favourites like Demon Slayer and One Piece to become the most watched series in the history of Crunchyroll, an anime streaming site for audiences outside Asia, according to Sony, which owns the platform. So fans are unconvinced Netflix can deliver what they expect. Those who watch the live-action remake \"will not get the same experience,\" insists Mr Guerrero, who expects the result to be \"a half-baked story\" where key plot points will be missing. Turning anime into live action is a formidable creative challenge and a balancing act: on the one hand is a discerning fandom and on the other hand, an irresistible  opportunity to find new audiences. Casting and production aside, it is essential to get the tone right, says Geoff Thew, who reviews anime on his YouTube channel \"Mother's Basement\" for nearly 1.4 million followers. \"Things that work, dramatically and aesthetically, in the heightened reality of animation don't always translate to live action,\" he says. \"The most iconic moments of the original anime might not work in live action, but whatever changes you make, those moments still need to be recognisable to fans.\" Hollywood first adapted anime into live-action in the 1990s but it did not go well. The 2009 adaptation of Dragonball Evolution was so ridiculed by fans of the four-decade-old iconic franchise that the scriptwriter felt compelled to publicly apologise years later. A 2017 film inspired by Japanese manga and 1995 anime film Ghost in the Shell, starring Scarlett Johansson, was lambasted for whitewashing and bombed - its losses reportedly exceeded $60m. Yet Hollywood is determined to try again with several big-ticket projects now under way. Legendary, the US film production company behind movies like Dune and Jurassic World, will be making a movie of Gundam, a military science fiction anime series about a giant robot that began in 1979. Sydney Sweeney is in final negotiations to star in it, according to media reports. Global content giant Lionsgate is reportedly developing Naruto, an anime about a young, underdog ninja who works his way up to become the village protector. \"There is almost a desire now to make the perfect live-action, to somehow figure out what the formula is,\" says Emerald King, a Japanese culture expert at the University of Tasmania, Australia. The size of the market may have something to do with it. The wider anime market, which also includes merchandising and music, was valued around $34bn in 2024, according to Grand View Research, and is projected to grow to over $60bn by 2030. Netflix doesn't usually release detailed viewership figures, but its latest data only appears to confirm the appetite for anime is growing. more than half of its 300 million subscribers watch anime, and the genre was watched more than one billion times in 2024, a three-fold rise in the last five years. \"Watching anime used to be like 'for weirdos' when I was younger,\" says Parisa Haghighat, a 34-year-old fan from the UK. She discovered anime like Doraemon and Sailor Moon in school when she used to spend her summer holidays in Thailand. She still watches anime, she says, although now \"it's more common and cool, so some people that used to make fun of me now watch it themselves!\" Reviewer Geoff Thew believes the pandemic played an important role in the \"seismic shift\" of attitudes towards anime: \"Being locked inside, people had a lot of free time and not much to do besides binge TV.\" To some, anime is \"a refreshing alternative\", says Cathy Boxall, global head of entertainment at marketing agency Dentsu. \"Audiences find it offers emotional complexity, genre diversity and cultural specificity.\" Fatigue with Hollywood franchises has emerged as a factor in research. One in 10 respondents to a Dentsu study said they watched anime because they were tired of Hollywood tropes. In the US, as many as three in 10 people watch anime when they want a break from Hollywood. So why bother with live-action adaptations, when anime itself is so appealing? With anime available so widely, Netflix likely sees live-action remakes as a differentiator, says Alex Cameron of Parrot Analytics. Regular watchers may want to watch the original anime after streaming the live-action - and that's longer retention and engagement, he added. Netflix also appears to be learning from past mistakes. Six years after the universally panned adaptation of Death Note, its 2023 live- action version of One Piece, featuring an international cast, won widespread praise. While there are attempts to make live-action treatments feel more authentic, Dr King says it needs a more thoughtful approach: \"You can go too far in trying to be respectful and end up exoticising it.\" The cast and crew should be \"aware of the product that's being made\", he adds. For example, One Piece, at its heart, is a series about pirates. \"It allows them to interpret the text in the spirit of the original. Without being a slave to the adaptation, it's allowed to be free,\" he says. Will the live-action version of Solo Leveling replicate One Piece's success? \"The overall tone of the series is comparable to a darker superhero movie. If the fights are cool and Sung Jin-woo gets a few chances to be a badass each episode, fans likely won't complain too much,\" Mr Thew says. Fans are indeed hopeful because Solo Leveling will be led by a Korean cast and crew. \"It is a good way to maintain most of the core of the story - some of the Hollywood casting leads to the loss of small cultural or story nuances, and these are sometimes the backbone of the story, \" says Archie Moyo, a fan from Zimbabwe. \"I'm excited about the live-action because it will introduce a lot more people to the Solo Leveling world.\""

        "title": "Would you work for no pay? The question behind the Air Canada strike",
        "text": "When Air Canada flight attendants walked off the job earlier a week ago, they had one rallying cry: \"Unpaid work won't fly.\" It was a reference to the long-standing practice in North America's aviation industry of not paying cabin crew for work they do when they are on the ground, before the plane is in motion. In contrast, some European airlines, industry experts told the BBC, pay cabin crew monthly wages rather than by the hour. The pay structure surprised Canadian flyers, . The brief strike wreaked havoc during the peak summer travel season, but flights resumed after both sides agreed to a tentative deal on Tuesday. The proposed agreement reached by the Canadian Union for Public Employees (Cupe) and Air Canada has not been fully released, but those familiar with its contents report that it includes a pay bump over several years and, most notably, partial pay for boarding duties and cabin secure checks before take off - a first. Experts say the wins secured by Air Canada's cabin crew could help solidify a new standard for aviation workers on the continent. The union called it \"historic\" earlier this week, declaring unpaid work \"over\". But media has reported that many flight attendants, who must still vote to approve the deal, remain dissatisfied. It is unclear if the deal has enough support to pass, Reuters reported. Air Canada flight attendants were not alone in not being paid for what the industry calls \"ground work\". Cabin crew for other Canadian airlines Air Transat and WestJet do not have ground pay as part of their compensation structure. Neither do flight attendants at US-based United Airlines, though contract negotiations are currently ongoing. John Gradek, a business professor and aviation management expert at McGill University in Montreal, said that introducing ground pay for Air Canada workers could trigger a \"tsunami\" that would soon sweep all major airlines in North America. For decades, the practice was justified on the basis that it is easier to track hours of when a plane leaves the gate and lands, he said. It is more difficult to include boarding time, which can vary depending on delays and the number of passengers. To mitigate this, airlines bumped up the hourly pay of cabin crew, though many argue the total wages are still low, especially for those living in major, often expensive, North American cities. Air Canada has said that half of its \"mainline flight attendants\" earned more than C$54,000 ($39,000; £29,000) last year, with some of the more senior staff earning more than C$70,000. The figures were slightly different for Air Canada Rouge, the carrier's discount wing. One long-time Air Canada flight attendant, Leslie Woolaver, told local news outlet the Halifax Examiner that she estimated she did about 40 hours of unpaid work a month. That figure is similar to what was reported by nearly 10,000 flight attendants in a At the time, Wesley Lesosky, president of the union's airline division, called unpaid work \"a dirty secret in this industry\". Junior flight attendants are most affected,  Ms Woolaver told the Halifax Examiner, as they tend to work shorter flights. Attitudes towards ground pay began to shift after the Covid-19 pandemic, which brought in new rules around masking on planes and greatly altered how cabin crew prepare a plane for take off. Steven Tufts, a professor and labour expert at York University in Toronto, said this \"increased complexity of boarding passengers put a lot of pressure on flight attendants\" and forced them to work even more unpaid hours. \"Eventually they said: 'No. This has to change,'\" he said. Delta Airlines led the charge in 2022 when it became the first in North America to offer cabin crew pay for work they did on the ground. American Airlines and Alaska Airlines quickly followed. After the tentative agreement with Air Canada was reached, that the carrier cabin crew will now receive \"industry leading compensation\". \"Ground pay is settled. Our flight attendants will be paid for time on the ground.\" But the future of the deal remains unclear. On Friday, who remained unhappy with the proposed deal, specifically citing ground pay and how it impacts wages for entry-level workers. Mr Lesosky told the outlet that further strikes would be illegal, and that wage disputes would likely be resolved at arbitration while the other parts of the agreement moved forward. Regardless of the outcome, some form of ground pay is likely to stay. With Air Canada - the largest airline in Canada - now hopping on board, industry watchers say a new precedent is being set for the global airline industry. Both Air Transat and WestJet have contract negotiations coming up. Prof Gradek said he believes ground pay will be an easy win for them, as they will want to keep their wages competitive. More broadly, the gains secured as a result of the Air Canada strike have also been hailed as a turning point for labour rights in Canada because of the union's refusal to comply with a back-to-work order. The federal government invoked Section 107 of the Canada Labour Code, which has been used in recent years to end job actions and force binding arbitration. This time, public sympathy was largely on the side of the striking workers due to the focus on unpaid labour, Prof Gradek said. \"This was a master class of negotiation by the union,\" he said."

        "title": "Were masterpieces worth £100m really found under a pensioner's bed?",
        "text": "Three previously unknown oil paintings attributed to avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich are on show at a public museum in Bucharest. If proven authentic, they could be worth over £100 million, but a top scholar says the story behind their origin is problematic. Now the museum exhibiting them is refusing to say whether the works are genuine. Ukraine-born Kazimir Malevich is considered one of the most influential 20th-Century artists. On the art market, his paintings are worth more than any other Ukrainian or Russian artist, with one work selling for a record $85m (£63m) in 2018. But during a house move in 2023, three unknown Malevich paintings were discovered under the mattress of Israeli pensioner Eva Levando, according to Yaniv Cohen, a Bucharest-based Israeli businessman and owner of the works. The pensioner is the grandmother of Mr Cohen's wife, and she had given him the works. The paintings are titled Suprematist Composition with Green and Black Rectangle (1918), Cubofuturist Composition (1912–13), and Suprematist Composition with Red Square and Green Triangle (1915–16), and they are being exhibited at Romania's National Museum of Contemporary Art until the end of August. The show is sponsored by Mr Cohen's dental clinic. Yet the art world remains sceptical. Konstantin Akinsha, a Ukrainian-American scholar, told the BBC that the records proving their history and tracing them to Malevich's studio were incomplete. \"The three works now exhibited in Bucharest were not documented, photographed, or shown during the artist's lifetime,\" said the art historian and curator, who co-authored the American Association of Museums guide to provenance research. Eva Levando inherited the paintings from her father, an accountant in Odesa in Soviet Ukraine. He allegedly bought one of them and received the other two as payment for his services. The absence of records to support this story is explained by Stalin-era repression of modernist art, Mr Cohen told the BBC. Ms Levando emigrated to Israel in 1990, taking the works with her, according to Mr Cohen. \"There is no evidence of Malevich's works circulating in the Russian or Ukrainian art markets of the late 1920s and early 1930s. Malevich's own records mention no private sales after 1917,\" said Konstantin Akinsha. But to bolster his claim, Yaniv Cohen presented certificates from Kyiv art historian Dmytro Horbachov describing the works as \"first-class examples\" of Malevich's style. He makes this conclusion by analysing the style and technique of the paintings. But Dmytro Horbachov has previously authenticated disputed works, including one painting after doubts over its authenticity. The art historian claims to be a consultant to Sotheby's and Christie's. But he \"does not work, and never has, for Sotheby's as a consultant\", a spokesperson told the BBC. Christie's also denies any formal association. Dmytro Horbachov did not respond to an interview request. Yaniv Cohen says technical analysis supports his claim. The BBC reviewed reports on all three works produced by the Institut d'Art Conservation et Couleur in Paris, and by the German laboratory of Elisabeth Jägers and Erhard Jägers. While dating pigments and other elements to Malevich's lifetime, the reports stop short of claiming the works were painted by the artist. Previously, reports from these two laboratories accompanied two paintings proven to be forgeries in a BBC documentary, The Zaks Affair: Anatomy of a Fake Collection. When presented with our findings, Erhard Jägers told the BBC that technical analysis could not prove authenticity of a painting. The French laboratory said the reports it produces \"are not proof of authenticity\" and that it has never issued an authenticity certificate for Malevich works. Yaniv Cohen insists he has no interest in selling the paintings, despite Dmytro Horbachov, who thinks the paintings are authentic, estimating they could be worth  $160m-190m (£118-140m). However, emails seen by the BBC indicated they were offered as collateral for a loan. The businessman denied connection to this offer, saying he had no plans to monetise the paintings and that he was financially secure thanks to cryptocurrency investments. Unhappy with the BBC's questions, Mr Cohen threatened to \"make [BBC journalists] disappear\" and claimed he could hack their communications. After Konstantin Akinsha questioned the paintings' provenance, Romania's National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC) distanced itself from the paintings. In a statement, MNAC \"a curatorial experiment\" and added that it did not have \"expertise in authenticating these particular works\". The museum said it relied on the documents provided by Mr Cohen and that the inclusion of his paintings in its exhibition \"should not be interpreted as institutional validation of their authorship or authenticity\". Konstantin Akinsha said publicly known cases of disputed works by Malevich and other artists of the period were only \"the tip of the iceberg, adding that \"thousands of questionable works continue to circulate today\". The market for Russian and Ukrainian modernist art was full of works that \"are obviously problematic\", Reto Barmettler, a consultant on Russian paintings with Sotheby's, told the BBC. \"Good avant-garde paintings don't come out of nowhere - they are of obvious quality, come with documented provenance and, ideally, an exhibition history,\" he explained. He did not comment on the three works owned by Yaniv Cohen."

        "title": "Why I started getting anti-wrinkle injections at 23",
        "text": "It was Sydney Brown's mother who first noticed her frown line. A couple of years ago, the pair were video calling when her mum pointed out a crease between her daughter's eyebrows. They decided it was the right time for Sydney, then 23, to start having anti-wrinkle injections. Now 25, Sydney has had both botox and lip filler. She is happy with her decision, and says she and her friends will do \"whatever it takes\" to feel more confident and \"look their best\". If that comes in the shape of cosmetic surgery - so be it. Sydney's mum, Dr Hayley Brown, an award-winning plastic surgeon based in Las Vegas, regularly injects small amounts of botox into her daughter's forehead. She says her daughter looks less tired, feels more confident and, Dr Brown believes, won't need more invasive surgery to smooth out deeper lines later in life. Using anti-wrinkle injections in the way Sydney does is known as \"preventative botox\". Botox users in their 20s and early 30s hope to prevent lines forming in the first place, or to target a crease before it becomes a wrinkle. The ageing process is inevitable, but are preventative cosmetic treatments a savvy way of holding on to our youth? Or are we just injecting thousands of pounds into an industry that's profiting from our insecurities? I have spoken to both users and experts in the hope of finding an answer. The less you contract your muscle, the less your skin creases, reducing the appearance of wrinkles. But what was once reserved for the ageing wealthy, or the elusive world of celebrities, has now reached the foreheads of 20-somethings across the UK. are carried out in the UK every year. Worldwide, the percentage of 18 to 34-year-olds opting for cosmetic tweaks is growing, In a brightly lit clinic in Prestwich, north Manchester, Dr Javed Hussain, a doctor and medical director of his company, Neo Derm, is preparing to treat his next client, 26-year-old Ven Grecu, who has been coming for botox for the past two years. He listens intently as Ven explains where he wants his treatment. When his client lifts his eyebrows up, his skin creases as he points at various areas. Poised with the needle, Dr Hussain warns: \"You will feel a short, sharp scratch…. there we go, over in seconds.\" Ven barely flinches. With a slightly reddened forehead, Ven turns his head to speak to me. \"I know I'm young,\" he says, \"But it's not an age factor. I'm having this as a way of preventing wrinkles. \"Not having them makes me feel so confident, it helps me in my job, and I want to age gracefully.\" So far, Ven, a business development manager, has spent thousands of pounds on treatment, but \"it's an investment in my confidence and it's worth every penny\", he says. But if a wrinkle isn't yet there, then how does having botulinum toxin injected into your face impede the ageing process? \"It doesn't stop you from ageing,\" Dr Hussain explains, \"but it does slow down its progress\". Dr Hussain says that, by targeting the dynamic wrinkles – the temporary creases we create when we make a facial expression – static lines are reduced in the long run. \"By relaxing the muscles that contract, we are reducing the number of times the skin wrinkles. \"That, in turn, prevents the lines from getting so deep.\" The practitioner says he is seeing an increase in the number of 18 and 19-year-olds coming in for treatment and, despite it being legal to inject anyone over the age of 18, he does turn them away. \"I've had some girls come in asking for botox and lip fillers - some asking for 3 or 4ml in their lips, which is a lot, especially if they haven't had any treatment before.\" Not everyone agrees with Dr Hussain that preventative botox is an effective way of preventing signs of ageing. Nora Nugent, consultant plastic surgeon and President of the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), does not recommend getting botox at such a young age, and says starting too early is a waste of money. \"You can't treat something that isn't there. Having it in your early 20s, with barely anything to treat, is spending a lot of money before you reap any benefit.\" She prefers to see clients when they already have faint lines – by then, she can see the nuances of how a face is ageing so she can adapt her treatment. \"There's nothing wrong with caring about your appearance or having aesthetic procedures, but it's important to have them for the right reason. \"It can almost become peer pressure – aesthetics is about choice and doing things that make you feel better about yourself rather than being pressured into doing it.\" It's this pressure that worries specialists such as Jen Tomei, a nutritional and eating disorder therapist, who gives talks in schools about body image. \"As a society, we are obsessed with anti-ageing. There is an increased awareness of procedures like botox and fillers among teenage students.\" She says she is worried about their mental health in the long run, and as part of her lessons she tries to get them to focus on other positive things about themselves, rather than just their appearance. \"They shouldn't be thinking about wrinkles now.\" Ashton Collins, director of Save Face, an organisation which campaigns for better regulation of the cosmetic industry, says she has seen patients as young as 18 with botox related complications after being treated by \"unscrupulous practitioners\". \"I'm very concerned about how preventative botox is being marketed, particularly posts on social media that target and pressure young women into treatments they do not need.\" She also warns that by having botox too early, and, if it's not carried out carefully, inappropriate treatment over a long period of time can cause altered expressions, an asymmetrical face and in some cases longer term muscle atrophy which can take years to recover from. She says that having botulinum toxin injected at such an early age risks building up a tolerance to it. She started when she was 26 and, now 37, needs it more frequently than ever as it wears off so quickly. There are a range of views when it comes to the preventative power of botox, but all the experts are in agreement that cleansing, moisturising and daily use of sunscreen can help prevent our skin from ageing prematurely. And if you are going to use treatments like botox - find a practitioner who is accredited with a medical background. As for what happens if you use botox regularly across a whole lifetime, we still don't have good research. Finding a cohort of people to study over the course of several decades is tricky. The healthiness of skin is multi factorial – lifestyle, environment, stress levels, diet and exercise regime all play into how our skin ages. And, given that botox only lasts three to six months, any longitudinal study would have to ensure participants are going for regular top-ups. And that's the crux, fighting the wrinkle is a war of attrition. Once you've had one treatment, because it wears off after just a few months, you have to keep going back for more. Sydney will continue to have anti-wrinkle injections. She completely trusts her mum to keep her looking young and, most importantly, natural. She says her mum will stop her from having too much and failing to recognise her own face changing by going \"botox blind\" or \"filler blind\". \"I only have a little bit, I will definitely continue. It's super easy to get it, my mum knows what she is doing and I feel so much more confident having it.\""

        "title": "For orca left in limbo, zoo resorts to sexual stimulation to stop inbreeding",
        "text": "A male killer whale at a closed marine zoo is being sexually stimulated by his trainers to stop him inbreeding with his mother. but managers, the French government and animal rights activists have not agreed on where or how the orcas should be rehomed. The closure comes ahead of a French law taking effect in December, which bans the use of whales in marine zoo shows. The impasse means the pair - Wikie, 24, and her 11-year-old son Keijo - are still being kept in their pools and being cared for by their trainers at the facility in southern France. Last week the activist group TideBreakers obtained overhead footage showing two trainers standing at the edge of a pool next to Keijo as he lies upside down. One trainer holds on to a flipper as the other stimulates the whale, who can be seen writhing about in the water. Wikie can be seen in an adjacent pool facing towards where her son is being held. Keeping them in separate pools permanently is considered harmful to their wellbeing as orcas are sociable animals. The footage was taken on 12 August and managers at Marineland tell BBC News the action was necessary as Keijo is reaching adolescence and has increasingly strong sexual urges. \"In order to avoid inbreeding with his mother, but also to prevent them from fighting and injuring each other, Marineland decided to sexually stimulate Keijo [to relieve him of his] tensions.\" Managers add: \"Although spectacular, this is natural and totally painless for the animals.\" The French ecology ministry, which must approve where the orcas are rehomed, say they were informed by Marineland that Keijo is being stimulated once a month and that a veterinary expert has been consulted about the process. Valerie Greene, a member of TideBreakers who worked at SeaWorld Orlando for a decade, tells us the stimulation of Keijo for sexual relief is unusual. \"As a former killer whale trainer, I've never seen this behaviour performed for anything other than attempting semen collection for use in artificial insemination.\" Female orcas kept captive in marine zoos can be artificially inseminated to breed more calves, which can later be used to attract more visitors and perform in shows. This was quite common until the last decade when laws were passed in countries, including France and the US, banning several breeding practices. However, breeding laws in Japan are less strict and activists believe marine zoo managers there may be interested in purchasing orca semen after the country's only male orca, Earth, died on 3 August. Just over a week after his death, Marineland's trainers were seen stimulating Keijo. Greene adds: \"Keijo is inbred, so it's even more concerning that his semen might be used for breeding of captive orcas.\" Keijo's mother and father are half-siblings. Managers at Marineland deny this was why Keijo was stimulated. They add the sale of semen is prohibited and any export would need authorisation from the French government. The French ecology ministry say Marineland have also told them there is no intention to collect and export orca semen for breeding purposes. \"Regardless of the reasoning, it's sad that this is a priority when Keijo desperately needs to be rescued because his environment is unsafe,\" says Greene. \"The notion that trainers are providing sexual relief to an orca... is a perverse new low in the captivity industry's morally bankrupt practices.\" Since then there have been no significant developments as to where the pair might end up and no European sanctuary site has been developed for them. There have also been mounting concerns about the conditions at Marineland and whether it is safe for Wikie and Keijo to remain there. Two weeks ago Pannier-Runacher released another Instagram video in which she tried to allay fears about the orcas' welfare and said regular inspections of the pools were taking place. Katheryn Wise, wildlife campaign manager at the charity World Animal Protection, who has been monitoring the situation, tells us: \"It is fair to say that the passivity of the French government when it comes to enabling alternatives for these animals, and communicating with organisations involved in developing professional sanctuary alternatives, is insufficient and is leading to unnecessary delays [in rehoming them].\" Rehoming animals after the closure of a zoo is often difficult, particularly for larger animals which require bigger facilities and higher levels of care. When Living Coasts, a marine zoo in Devon, announced its closure in 2020, managers warned they might have to euthanise animals for whom they could not find new homes. Eventually places were found for all of them. After Orsa Predator Park in Sweden shut in 2022, some of their polar bears did not find new homes until the following year. Two of the but one died shortly after arriving. Following a request by a French court, an expert assessment is being carried out of Marineland's facilities and whether the orcas, and a dozen dolphins also still housed there, should be moved. The French ecology ministry told us: \"A task force set up by the ministry is working, under the aegis of the environment ambassador Barbara Pompili, to define a coordinated strategy at the European level for the care of orcas and dolphins, particularly those at Marineland.\" For Marketa Schusterova, a videographer who co-founded TideBreakers, the situation for Wikie and Keijo is bleak. She says: \"We have been advocating for a temporary tank to be built and expedited until a sanctuary is ready, but we're worried that we are past that point. Time is running out.\""

        "title": "US government wants to deport Kilmar Ábrego García to Uganda",
        "text": "Less than 24 hours after his release, US authorities have informed Kilmar Ábrego García that he may be deported to Uganda, following his refusal to accept a plea deal in a pending criminal case, his lawyers say. Attorneys for Mr Ábrego García say he declined an offer to plead guilty to human smuggling charges in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica - a deal proposed after it became clear he would be released from custody. His lawyers now accuse the US government of trying to \"coerce\" him to plead guilty by threatening to re-deport him \"halfway across the world\" to Uganda. The Salvadoran national was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, and then brought back to face criminal charges. The deal to be sent to Costa Rica was offered on Thursday after it became clear Mr Ábrego García would likely be freed from a Tennessee jail on Friday. The Costa Rican government agreed to accept him as a refugee and provide him legal status there, a letter from a Costa Rican official included in the legal filing says. Mr Abrego Garcia would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the court filing. His attorneys now say that upon Mr Ábrego García's release from federal custody, they were informed of the government's intention to deport him to Uganda - a country with which he has no known ties. \"The DOJ, DHS, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,\" the lawyers wrote in the filing. The lawyers say Mr Ábrego García has until Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, \"or else that offer will be off the table forever\". It was not immediately clear whether he was considering the government offer. Now in Maryland with his family, Mr Ábrego García is scheduled to appear in a Baltimore immigration court on Monday. If a judge approves the government's request, he could face deportation within days. The US reached bilateral deportation agreements with Honduras and Uganda as part of its crackdown on illegal immigration, \"This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted,\" Bagiire Vincent Waiswa, permanent secretary to the Ugandan foreign ministry, said in a statement. \"Uganda also prefers that individuals from African countries shall be the ones transferred to Uganda.\" Mr Ábrego García's deportation case has become a fixture of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration. He was deported to his native El Salvador in March, and initially kept in the notorious Cecot prison. But after US government officials acknowledged he was deported due to an \"administrative error\", a judge ordered the administration to \"facilitate\" his return. He was returned to the United States in early June and sent to the state of Tennessee, where he was charged in a human smuggling scheme. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. In late June, a federal judge in Tennessee had ruled that Mr Ábrego García was eligible for release, but remained in jail over fears from his own legal team that he could be swiftly deported again if he left the facility."

        "text": "Pope Leo XIV has said he is \"delighted\" the UK has agreed to hand the Chagos Islands to Mauritius. Speaking to a delegation of 15 refugees from Chagos, Pope Leo said that the move represented a \"significant victory\" in their long battle to \"repair a grave injustice\". Under the terms of , Mauritius will gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a military base on one of the islands, Diego Garcia, for an initial period of 99 years. The pope said he hoped Mauritian authorities would ensure the refugees are able to return home. UK opposition leaders - and some Chagossians now resident in the UK - have criticised the deal. Speaking in French, Pope Leo said: \"The renewed prospect of your return to your native archipelago is an encouraging sign and a powerful symbol on the international stage.\" He added that all people \"must be respected by the powerful in their identity and rights, in particular the right to live on their land; and no one can force them into exile\". The UK purchased the islands for £3m in 1968, but Mauritius has argued it was illegally forced to give away the islands in order to get independence from Britain. The islands were then cleared to make way for a UK-US armed forces base with large groups of Chagossians moving to Mauritius and the Seychelles, or taking up an invitation to settle in England, mainly in Crawley, West Sussex. In May, the government said it would pay Mauritius an average of £101m a year for 99 years under the terms of the agreement. The deal sets a 24-mile buffer around Diego Garcia, where nothing can be built without UK consent. Foreign military and civilian forces will also be barred from other islands in the archipelago, with the UK retaining a power to veto any access to the islands. The treaty will come into effect only after it is approved by both the UK and Mauritian parliaments. When the deal was struck, the Conservatives described it as \"an act of national self-harm\", which left the UK \"more exposed to China\" because of its ties with Mauritius. The prime minister insisted that the deal was imperative to maintaining the UK's national security. \"If we did not agree this deal the legal situation would mean that we would not be able to prevent China or any other nation setting up their own bases on the outer islands or carrying out joint exercises near our base,\" Sir Keir Starmer said. \"No responsible government could let that happen.\" The agreement was welcomed by Mauritian Attorney General Gavin Glover who told the BBC in May: \"Our country is elated that this 60-year struggle is finally over.\" However two women born in Diego Garcia who wanted to be able to return there had raised a last-minute legal challenge to the deal in May. The High Court went on to dismiss the challenge."

        "title": "Turkish first lady appeals to Melania Trump over Gaza children",
        "text": "Turkey's first lady has urged Melania Trump to speak out for children suffering in Israel's war in Gaza. Emine Erdogan praised the US first lady's support for children affected by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, asking Trump to \"extend the advocacy\" to Palestinians. In a letter published by the Turkish presidency on Saturday, Mrs Erdogan said Gaza had become a '\"children's cemetery\", telling Mrs Trump: \"We must unite our voices and strength against this injustice.\" It comes as - and 132,000 children's lives are threatened by malnutrition. \"The phrase 'unknown baby' written on the shrouds of thousands of Gazan children opens irreparable wounds in our consciences,\" Mrs Erdogan wrote. The letter calls on Mrs Trump to \"show the same sensitivity to Gaza that you have shown to Ukrainian children who have lost their lives in the war\". Mrs Erdogan also encouraged Mrs Trump to appeal directly to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to \"end to the humanitarian crisis in Gaza\". Earlier this month, , imploring him to consider children, but did not reference any specific children. The Turkish first lady does not usually involve herself in politics, more often choosing to be active in environmental issues - which has earned her praise from UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. But Mrs Erdogan has written letters to the partners of world leaders in the past, in 2016 on behalf of Syrians caught up in civil war and condemning Israel's actions in Gaza in March. The letter was published in the wake of a . The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) report confirmed a famine in and around Gaza City - warning that more than 640,000 people will face \"catastrophic conditions\" between mid-August and the end of September. In Friday's report, the IPC noted the particular toll food shortages had taken on children - roughly one in three in Gaza are acutely malnourished. It also projects that up to June 2026, malnutrition will threaten the lives of 132,000 children aged under five. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said 114 of the 281 people who have died from malnutrition are children. Israel denies there is famine in Gaza. It also accuses IPC experts of being biased, changing its methods for assessing famine, and using data coming from Hamas. The IPC has rejected this criticism. The report comes as Israel prepares to launch a new military offensive aimed at occupying Gaza City. Gaza's health ministry has reported 61 deaths in the past 24 hours after Israeli attacks. It said eight people, including two children, have died as a result of malnutrition in the same period. In one attack on a displacement camp in the southern city of Khan Younis, 19 people were killed, according to Palestinian news agency Wafa. Israel's military launched a campaign in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 others were taken hostage. At least 62,122 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times; more than 90% of homes are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; and the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed."

        "title": "National flags have started lining our streets. They may say something more",
        "text": "Driving through the south west of Birmingham, it's hard not to notice something about the lampposts. For more than a mile, almost every one has a St George's or union jack flag attached - thousands of them. In one district, Weoley Castle, the BBC found two men carrying a ladder and shopping bags. A DIY trip this was not, because as we stop to talk to them one rests the ladder against a lamppost, the other pulls a union jack flag from the bag, and the next minute it's flying high. They tell us they want to spread \"love, unity and patriotism\", but don't want to be filmed or interviewed. They direct us to a local cafe where flags and donations are being collected to find out more. It's rare to see national flags lining our streets like this in Great Britain, beyond special occasions like royal, sporting or military events, so why are they appearing now - and does this say something bigger about people's perceptions of modern-day Britain? The latest phenomenon started in mid-July in Weoley Castle and spread to neighbouring areas. In the last week it has rippled not just across the West Midlands, but other parts of England including Worcester, Bradford, Greater Manchester, Newcastle and Norwich. In the cafe, we're told the first flags were put up in Weoley Castle's square in response to a story in the nearby town of Rugby about a 12-year-old girl who was in her school, while wearing a union jack-themed dress. She was wearing the outfit for Bilton School's \"culture celebration day\", for which pupils were asked to wear cultural dress rather than school uniform. The school has since offered \"unreserved apologies\" to the girl over the incident. As the story gathered steam online, a group named the Weoley Warriors was formed, locals told us in the cafe, initially by three men but now said to have several dozen members. We know little about this group and who exactly is behind it. What we do know is that in the last few weeks, it has been prolific on social media with its bold lion-themed logo, mainly being shared by individual accounts. It has a private Facebook group of 1,600 members and has launched an online crowdfunder, raising nearly £14,000, which the group says will be used only \"for flags, poles and cable ties\". On the crowdfunder page, Weoley Warriors describes itself as \"a group of proud English men with a common goal to show Birmingham and the rest of the country how proud we are of our history, freedoms and achievements, giving hope to local communities that all isn't lost and they are not alone\". A TikTok account with the name Weoley Warriors has used the hashtag \"operation raise the colours\" in some posts, a phrase that many accounts are using alongside pictures of various flag locations. \"Operation Raise the Colours\" is also the name of another group that has encouraged people to put up flags and is alleged to have accepted a donation from the far-right organisation Britain First, . According to the research group , Operation Raise the Colours was co-founded by Andrew Currien, otherwise known as Andy Saxon, who has allegedly had links with the English Defence League and Britain First. The group denies it is a far-right organisation. While the Weoley Warriors has focused activities on Birmingham, Operation Raise the Colours claims to have supplied flags to areas such as Wolverhampton, West Bromwich and Staffordshire. On Thursday in London's Canary Wharf a large group of men, many masked, raised hundreds of flags in support of the campaign. In some other areas, the raising of flags appears to be spontaneous, coinciding with a , particularly England, when it comes to national identity and belonging. There have been protests outside some hotels housing asylum seekers where union jack and St George's flags have featured heavily among the placards. There's an in the Essex town of Epping, and more demonstrations are planned, where speakers often touch on themes of nationhood. But the fact that both the St George's and union jack flags have been used as emblems for far-right political movements, over many years, has meant some residents in Birmingham have been uncomfortable with the motivations of some of those backing the Weoley Warriors. A man in the suburb of Kings Heath, where a roundabout was vandalised, said it was \"not patriotic, it just feels like an excuse for xenophobia\". Sarah Milne, who knows the original members of Weoley Warriors, tells us the idea behind it has been to show pride in the country and \"to take the flag back from the racists\". She believes it is part of a reaction to a general sense of malaise - \"everybody's so upset with the way the country's being run, the way we're being treated\". There has been no response from the Weoley Warriors after the BBC tried to contact the group multiple times via social media and the crowdfunder page. All the locals we have chatted to in Weoley Castle support the flags, but for different reasons. Some say it's about patriotism and civic pride, some talk about immigration while others point to Palestinian flags that, while far fewer in number, have long flown in other parts of the city. The reaction six miles away in the flag-lined village of Barnt Green, Worcestershire, has been more muted with several people telling the BBC they are pleased about the flags but others expressing unease - one man fearing they might cause division. It gets to the heart of how many Britons' relationship with the union jack and the four nations' flags is complex. Sociologist and author Ellis Cashmore believes those displaying the flags probably have different reasons for doing so, but generally feel a sense of being left behind or overlooked. For some, the potentially to come this autumn may be contributing to this sense of disillusionment. \"If people reach the conclusion that they're being either silenced or ignored, they want to do something about it,\" he tells us. \"Of course they don't have the means to make a formal protest, so what do they do? They start sticking out these flags, waving them… They want people to pay attention to them.\" Those raising flags on lampposts in recent weeks have used mostly union jacks, but others - particularly those painting roundabouts and zebra crossings - have chosen the St George's Cross, which symbolises the patron saint of England. The St George's flag has sometimes had a closer association with English nationalists, and the union jack has been used frequently by mainstream political parties including the Tories and Labour. Alongside these flags, you can currently see the Scottish Saltire, Welsh Dragon, and Irish tricolour on one of the busiest roads in Birmingham. In Greater Manchester, where flags have begun to emerge too, mayor Andy Burnham that \"flags are contentious… especially the flag of St George\". \"I don't think you need to start going out painting your community, you can obviously display a flag if that's your choice but I don't know, I do wonder about the times we're living in,\" he said. \"It's like people are seeking confrontation.\" It echoes a warning from Dorset council's leader Nick Ireland, a Liberal Democrat, who said on Friday that some residents were finding the St George flags appearing there \"intimidating\" and it was \"naive\" to suggest the emblems had not been \"hijacked\" by some far-right groups. As a political row develops over the response to the flags and roundabouts, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch waded in on Saturday to say councils removing the flags on lampposts were behaving in a \"shameful\" way and applying rules \"selectively\". Rather than being seen as an \"act of rebellion\" such flags should be \"welcomed\", she wrote in the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, the Labour-run city council in Birmingham has been accused of leaving Palestinian flags up but taking down. Initially officials said the latter were a health and safety risk and would be removed. The council has also said only 200 flags have been taken down since the start of January and none since 1 August. Many of the Palestinian flags in Birmingham have popped up sporadically, on only one or two lampposts rather than lining the streets. An exception to this was at the start of July when lampposts between the University of Birmingham and the Edgbaston cricket ground were bedecked with Palestinian flags - they were quickly taken down. In a view that diverged somewhat from Burnham's comments, another Labour mayor - Richard Parker of the West Midlands - said this week: \"I've seen them, I agree that they are uplifting all of us… displays of patriotism are something I support, so that's my position and I think that is increasingly the position of the councils in the regions and politicians from all sides.\" in some of the roundabout-spraying incidents, with West Mercia Police saying this week it was investigating it as criminal damage in Bromsgrove and West Midlands Police saying it was carrying out inquiries. It remains unclear how long this will last. Will patriotic flags become a more permanent fixture of residential streets in Britain, like in many US neighbourhoods where they are commonplace? As flag flying and roundabout spraying grew in Greater Manchester this week, Burnham asked people to \"chill out\" - something many seem to find easier said than done at the moment."

        "text": "US defence secretary Pete Hegseth has fired the Pentagon's intelligence agency chief, just weeks after a White House rebuke of a review assessing the impact of American strikes on Iran. Lt Gen Jeffery Kruse will no longer serve as head of US Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Pentagon said in a statement. Two other senior military commanders have also been ousted by the Pentagon. The defence department has not offered any immediate explanation on the firings. In June, President Donald Trump strongly on a leaked DIA report that found that attacks on Iran had set back its nuclear programme by months only. The White House declared the agency's assessment \"flat out wrong\". Trump had declared the nuclear sites in Iran \"completely destroyed\", and had accused the media of \"an attempt to demean one of the most successful military strikes in history\". Speaking at the Nato summit at the time, Hegseth had said that the report was made on \"low intelligence\" and that the FBI was probing the leak. Kruse's exit was first reported by the Washington Post. The DIA is part of the Pentagon and specialises in military intelligence to support operations. It collects large amounts of technical intelligence, but is distinct from other agencies like the CIA. It is understood that Hegseth had also ordered the removal of the chief of US Naval reserves and the commander of Naval Special Warfare Command, an anonymous source told Reuters on Friday. In  a statement, US Senator Mark Warner warned that Kruse's sacking was a sign that Trump had a \"dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country\". Trump has removed a number of officials whose analysis have been seen to be at odds with the president. In July, Trump said that he had ordered his team to dismiss Commissioner of Labor Statistics Erika McEntarfer \"immediately\", after a report showed that job growth had slowed. And in April, Trump fired General Timothy Haugh as director of the National Security Agency, along with more than a dozen staff at the White House national security council. Hegseth has also pushed out a number of military officials at the Pentagon. In February, he fired Air Force General C Q Brown, who was dismissed along with five other admirals and generals."

        "title": "How researchers recreated faces of 2,500-year-old skulls found in India",
        "text": "In a modest-sized university lab in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu, researchers are using a tiny drill to scrape away enamel from a 2,500-year-old tooth. Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University say the tooth belongs to one of two human skulls that they have used as models to digitally reconstruct faces to understand what the region's early inhabitants might have looked like. The skulls, both belonging to men, were excavated from Kondagai, an ancient burial site about 4km (2.5 miles) from Keeladi - an archaeological site that has . Tamil Nadu state department archaeologists say an urban civilisation dating back to 580BC existed in Keeladi, a claim that adds a new dimension to the story of the Indian subcontinent. The Indus Valley Civilisation, that emerged over 5,000 years ago in the northern and central parts of present-day India, is the country's first major civilisation - and narratives around urbanisation have so far been confined to the north. But state archaeologists say the findings at Keeladi indicate for the first time that an ancient independent civilisation existed in southern India as well. They say the people of Keeladi were literate, highly-skilled and engaged in trade across the subcontinent and abroad. They lived in brick houses and buried their dead along with daily necessities like food grains and pots in massive burial urns in Kondagai. Archaeologists have excavated about 50 such urns from the site so far. Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University are now extracting DNA from human bones and other goods found in these urns to better understand who the inhabitants of Keeladi were and what their lifestyle was like. But a more profound quest seems to be under way. \"We want to understand our ancestry and the migration routes of our ancestors,\" says professor G Kumaresan, who heads the genetics department at the university. \"It's a journey towards answering the larger question of 'who are we and how did we come to exist here',\" he adds. The exercise of reconstructing faces of the 2,500-year-old skulls has revealed clues that can answer at least one part of this question. \"The faces mainly have features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians - a population group believed to be the first inhabitants of the Indian subcontinent,\" says Prof Kumaresan. The features also reveal traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiactic ancestries, hinting at global migration and the mixing of ancient population groups. But Prof Kumaresan says that more research is needed to properly establish the ancestries of Keeladi's residents. The facial reconstruction of the skulls began with researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University creating 3D scans of the skulls. These digital scans were then sent to Face Lab at Liverpool John Moores University in the UK. Face Lab specialises in creating digital craniofacial reconstructions using forensic, artistic and scientific principles and technologies. Experts at the lab used computer softwares to add muscles, flesh and skin to the scans of skulls, bringing out their facial features. These additions were made according to standard human anatomical proportions and measurements. Then came the big challenge: adding colour to the images. This brought up questions like which shade of brown should the men be, what colour should their eyes have and how should their hair look? Prof Kumaresan says the standard practice of using colours that matched physical traits of people currently living in Tamil Nadu was followed, but the digital portraits still evoked lively discussions on social media. They underscored longstanding divisions in Indian society - around race, culture and heritage. Historical narratives championing Aryans (a term commonly used to describe people who settled in the northern part of India) as the \"original citizens\" of the country clashed with those that ascribed this title to Dravidians (a term used to describe people living primarily in India's southern states). India has always been plagued by a north-south divide that stems partly from the popular belief that Indian civilisation - and everything associated with it, like language, culture and even religion - took root in the north and shaped the rest of the country. But Prof Kumaresan says the facial portraits of the Keeladi skulls reveal a message that's more complex and inclusive. \"The message we can all take home is that we are more diverse than we realise, and the proof of this lies in our DNA,\" he says. This isn't the first time that researchers in India have attempted to recreate faces from ancient skulls. In 2019, scientists reconstructed faces of two skulls found at a cemetery in Rakhigarhi - an important Indus Valley Civilisation site in India. But the sketches lack colour and other physical traits. \"As humans, we have a fascination with faces – our ability to recognise and interpret faces is part of our success as a social species,\" says Caroline Wilkinson, who headed the Face Lab team that worked on the Keeladi men. \"These facial depictions also encourage the audience to understand ancient remains as people rather than artefacts, and to establish a connection through personal narrative rather than a wider population history,\" she adds. At the Madurai Kamaraj University, efforts are under way to study Keeladi as thoroughly as the Indus Valley Civilisation. \"So far, we have learnt that the people of Keeladi were involved in agriculture, trade and cattle-rearing. They kept deer, goats and wild pigs and ate lots of rice and millets,\" says Prof Kumaresan. \"Interestingly, we have found evidence that they also consumed dates, even though the date palm isn't ubiquitous in Tamil Nadu at present,\" he adds. But the most challenging task for his team remains extracting sufficient DNA from human skeletons found at Kondagai to create a gene library. Because the skeletons are badly degraded, the DNA extracted from them is low and of poor quality. But Prof Kumaresan is hopeful that some good will come out of these endeavours. \"Ancient DNA libraries are like portals to the past; they can reveal fascinating insights about life as it was and life as we know it to be,\" he says."

        "text": "The government is planning an overhaul of the asylum appeals system, as it tries to cut the number of migrants staying in hotels while they await a ruling. A new, independent body will be established, staffed by independent adjudicators, with the aim of hearing cases more quickly. The Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, said she was taking practical steps to end unacceptable delays. The government has been under increasing pressure to reduce its reliance on asylum hotels. It now wants to regain the initiative. Ministers have pledged to end hotel use in this parliament - but 32,000 asylum seekers are still housed in them. Cooper said that while initial decisions on asylum applications had been speeded up, there had been \"unacceptable delays\" when people who were turned down decided to appeal. It currently takes on average just over a year for an appeal to be heard and 51,000 cases are awaiting a decision. During this time failed asylum seekers are accommodated at the taxpayers' expense. So a new panel of independent adjudicators  is to be appointed to deal with appeals - ministers believe it will act more swiftly than the courts. The government has promised to give more details about how it will speed up cases in the autumn. The Conservatives have said the system is in chaos while . The past week has seen rising frustration over where asylum seekers are housed, with on Saturday to protest against the use of hotels. Epping has been a focal point for protesters since July, with thousands of people demonstrating outside the Bell Hotel after a resident asylum seeker was charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in the town. On Tuesday the High Court in the Bell Hotel, after it argued that the hotel had breached local planning controls by changing its use, resulting in events that were a public safety risk. Those currently in residence must be moved out by 16:00 on 12 September. The government is seeking the right to appeal against the High Court ruling. Cooper said the government was committed to closing all asylum hotels but that it needed to happen in \"a properly managed way\". A number of other councils are reportedly considering taking legal action following the ruling, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch published an open letter urging Conservative council leaders \"to take the same steps if your legal advice supports it\", while Reform UK's Nigel Farage wrote in the Telegraph that councils controlled by his party would do \"everything in their power\" to follow Epping's lead. According to figures published by the Home Office earlier this week, , primarily made up of hotels. Of those 131 areas, 74 are fully or partially led by Labour, 30 by the Liberal Democrats, 19 by the Conservatives, nine by the Green Party and one by Reform UK."

        "title": "'AI can't write comedy', Tina Fey tells Edinburgh TV Festival",
        "text": "Saturday Night Live star Tina Fey said she is not worried about artificial intelligence (AI) taking over from comedy writers. \"AI can do all sorts of other terrifying things, like writing music but so far, it's unable to be funny,\" she told the audience on the last day of the Edinburgh TV Festival. The American actress and comedian broke into comedy as part of the Chicago-based improvisational comedy group The Second City, before going on to star in the NBC sketch comedy show. One of her most famous roles was as US vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin in the run up to the 2008 election. At the time she had left the show but was asked to return. Fey said: \"I wasn't sure. I know I looked a little like her but I also knew someone like Kristen Wigg could have done with ease.\" But for six weeks, it made her famous. She added: \"So many people watched it and recognised me. They'd come up to me in the street. \"A French newspaper even ran a picture of me and Amy Poehler as Hillary Clinton, thinking we were the real people. \"At the end of it all, it started to get a little scary, and then it peeked when Sarah Palin appeared on the show.\" In April it was announced that the UK would launch its own version of the long running sketch show, produced by the US show's creator Lorne Michaels. Graham Norton, who shared the festival stage with Fey, said he didn't believe that British writers would stay up all night on a Tuesday, as they do in the US, to finish scripts in time for the Wednesday read through. But Fey said: \"Here's a dirty secret. You don't have to do it that way. You could start in the morning.\" Fey, who created 30 Rock, also revealed former Prime Minister David Cameron had wanted to speak to her about British shows while he was in power. She recalled: \"After 30 Rock ended, like a year or two later, I was way out in Brooklyn working on this show called Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. \"I was very happy to take a break from being on camera, jeans and dirty hair every day. \"And I got this call from someone at NBC that said if you could come into Rockefeller Centre, David Cameron is here and has requested to meet you. \"He was the current prime minister. Turned out all it was, was he wanted to meet me and say Hi.\" Fay said Cameron invited her to the UK but she didn't take up the offer. She continued: \"He was like 'Would you ever be willing to come and meet with some of our incredibly talented British show writers? I think that our television that we make is one of our greatest exports, it's something we do beautifully, and could you convince them to make hundreds of episodes?' \"And I was like I cannot, because we all want to do it the way they do it, be Ricky Gervais and be like 'Remember that time I made 12 half-hours'. That's the lifestyle.\" Meanwhile, Fey described her latest show, The Four Seasons - which is based on a 1981 film - as \"an exercise in restraint\". She added: \"I had to keep saying to the other writers, when a character meets another person, they have to be normal, not outrageous.\" The second season of the show is now in production and she said her own experience of mid-life offered her plenty of ideas. Fey said: \"I'm 55, and stuff can happen at that age, and some of it is terrible.\" She also told the festival how she grew up with British television classics like Monty Python and Benny Hill. And when asked to name her favourite shows of the last 50 years, Fey nominated Absolutely Fabulous and I May Destroy You. The comedian was asked for her favourite Scottish film by a member of the audience and - despite this being her first visit to the country - confidently answered . Fey also revealed she was keen to return to the UK to tour The Restless Leg, the show she created with Amy Poehler about their 30-year friendship."

        "title": "Prison conduct, remorse and contraband: What we learned from Menendez parole hearings",
        "text": "Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole after appearing before separate boards in California this week. The brothers have spent decades behind bars for killing their wealthy parents in 1989. They claimed self-defence, and have long pushed for their freedom. Erik, now 54, attended his hearing on Thursday.  Lyle, 57, appeared before a different panel on Friday.  Both hearings were lengthy and held remotely. They revealed details about the pair's time in prison – some of which explain why the panels denied their release. In Erik's case, parole commissioner Robert Barton said the main reason for his denial was not the killings themselves, but Menendez's behaviour in prison. Barton rejected the notion that he had been a \"model prisoner\". He cited Menendez's involvement in fights, drug use and even a tax-fraud scam while linked to a gang. Erik was revealed to have stashed banned objects including ingredients for making wine and art materials – which he used to decorate his cell. Barton said Menendez's \"institutional misconduct showed a lack of self-awareness\". At Lyle's hearing the next day, parole commissioner Julie Garland acknowledged the prisoner's \"remorse\" and the changes he had made while incarcerated. \"But despite all those outward positives, we see... you still struggle with anti-social personality traits like deception, minimisation and rule breaking that lie beneath that positive surface,\" Garland said. Garland said \"incarcerated people who break rules\" are more likely to break rules in society. Both boards highlighted the brothers' repeated use of mobile phones – which are prohibited in prisons. Erik stated that he initially felt that connecting with the outside world meant more to him \"than the consequences of me getting caught with the phone\", but he said he had later rethought this view. The issue of phones also featured prominently in Lyle's case – he has pleaded guilty to a mobile phone violation as recently as March of this year. Although he had a tablet that he was allowed to use, Lyle explained that he had resorted to mobile phones because they gave him more privacy. \"I would never call myself a model incarcerated person. I would say that I'm a good person, that I spent my time helping people,\" Lyle told the board, noting he's done a lot for vulnerable inmates. Erik, who was 18 at the time of the murders, was asked why he and brother had shot dead their parents rather than simply leave home. They have long claimed the killings were a matter of self-defence, as their father was sexually abusing them. \"When I look back at the person I was then and what I believed about the world and my parents, running away was inconceivable,\" Menendez responded. \"Running away meant death.\" He added: \"I just want my family to understand that I am so unimaginably sorry for what I have put them through.\" Lyle, who is regarded as the dominant brother, also insisted that more than three decades on he was a different person. \"I'm profoundly sorry for who I was… for the harm that everyone has endured.  I will never be able to make up for the harm and grief I caused everyone in my family.\" Asked why they killed their mother as well as their father, Erik said he \"saw them as one person\" after he learned that his mother was aware of the abuse. Lyle said it was his \"honest belief\" at the time that his parents \"were going to kill\" him. Many people, mostly relatives, spoke in their support during the hearings. The brothers' aunt Teresita Menendez-Baralt, tearfully said she forgave the pair for killing her brother. Explaining that she had late-stage cancer, she spoke of her wish to welcome Erik into her home to \"wrap my arms around\" him before it was too late. Lyle's cousin Eileen Cano, who spoke at both hearings, told the board that she is amazed by how much Lyle had achieved despite facing life in prison. \"While most people surrender to the crushing weight of prison life, Lyle rose above it,\" she said. \"Lyle will not be a risk to the community because we as a family will hold him accountable,\" she continued. \"Delaying his release would serve no purpose..\" Barton acknowledged the support, but told Erik: \"Two things can be true. They can love and forgive you, and you can still be found unsuitable for parole.\""

        "title": "Ghislaine Maxwell denies seeing 'inappropriate' conduct by Trump",
        "text": "Ghislaine Maxwell, the jailed associate of sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, has told US officials she did not witness any inappropriate conduct by Donald Trump or former President Bill Clinton. The Trump administration has faced pressure to disclose information about Epstein, who the US president had been friendly with. Maxwell was interviewed from prison in July and, according to the newly released transcript, told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche that a much-discussed \"client list\" does not exist. The interview outraged the family of - who say the government has given Maxwell \"a platform to rewrite history\". Maxwell is seeking a pardon from Trump and has been accused of lying to federal officials. Shortly after the interview with Blanche - who previously worked as Trump's personal attorney - .  It is unclear why the move was made. She is currently serving a 20-year sentence in a sex-trafficking scheme, and has petitioned the US Supreme Court to overturn her conviction. Her lawyer has said they would \"welcome\" a pardon from the president. She also called allegations of Prince Andrew having sexual relations with an underage girl in Maxwell's home \"mind-blowingly not conceivable\". Although the name of the girl was redacted, it was clear from the context that Maxwell was discussing Giuffre, who had claimed she was paid to have sex with the prince in Maxwell's house. the three of them together when she was 17. , but denied liability. \"I believe it's literally a fake photo,\" Maxwell said during the interview. Giuffre's family said they were \"outraged\" by the content of Maxwell's interview with the Justice Department. \"During DAG Todd Blanche's bizarre interview, she is never challenged about her court-proven lies, providing her a platform to rewrite history,\" the statement reads. \"This travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\" The White House has been adamant that \"no leniency is being given or discussed\" in Maxwell's case. Trump has maintained that he fell out with Epstein in 2004. The president has accused his political opponents of using the case to distract from what he sees as his administration's victories. But he has also faced pressure from his own Republican Party for more transparency around investigations of Epstein. In the transcripts - which amount to 300 pages, some heavily redacted - Maxwell said that while she believed Trump and Epstein were friendly \"in social settings\", she did not think they were close friends. \"I actually never saw the president in any type of massage setting,\" she said - alluding to the massage services that some Epstein victims have mentioned. \"The president was never inappropriate with anybody.\" \"In the times I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects,\" she added. She also said she did not recall Trump sending Epstein a 50th birthday note in 2003, which drew recent headlines after the note was reported in the Wall Street Journal. In the interview, Blanche also asked Maxwell about the alleged \"client list\" of high-profile personalities that has become the object of conspiracy theories in recent years. Maxwell was asked about several well-known figures, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr, actor Kevin Spacey, model Naomi Campbell and Prince Andrew - whom she denied she introduced to Epstein. The list of his high-profile associates had become a focal point for conspiracy theorists who insisted that it was being kept hidden by the \"deep state\" to protect prominent participants in Epstein's crimes. Several figures in Trump's administration - including FBI Director Kash Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino - repeated those claims in the past, although they have since backtracked. \"There is no list,\" Maxwell said. Maxwell also spoke about Prince Andrew, whose relationship with Epstein eventually led to him stepping down from royal duties. She called it a \"flat untruth\" that she'd been the one who introduced the Duke of York to Epstein. \"First of all, let's just state, I did not introduce him to Prince Andrew,\" she said. She spoke at length of Epstein's relationship with both Prince Andrew and the Duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson. Prince Andrew has previously said that Maxwell introduced him to Epstein. But Maxwell said she believed it was the duchess who was responsible. When approached by the BBC about Maxwell's claim, Sarah Ferguson's representatives declined to comment. Maxwell also spoke about Prince Andrew's alleged relationship with a woman whose name has been redacted in the transcript. She said she found the allegations against the Duke of York \"mind-blowingly not conceivable\", partly due to the size of her house where the events allegedly took place. She was also asked about a \"famous photo\" of Prince Andrew and the unnamed woman, with Maxwell in the background. She told Blanche this photo was fake. The prince was accused by Virginia Giuffre, who is not named in the transcript, of sexually abusing her when she was 17. He denied the allegations but reached a financial settlement with her in 2022, which contained no admission of liability or apology. A widely circulated photo shows him alongside Giuffre with Maxwell in the background. Andrew has previously disputed its authenticity. Giuffre took her own life earlier this year. Her family has condemned the justice department for interviewing Maxwell and said she is a \"monster\" whose testimony cannot be trusted. According to Maxwell, she first befriended Epstein in 1991, and subsequently developed a sexual relationship with him. Even after that relationship ended, she said she was still paid by Epstein - up to $250,000 (£184,782) a year by 2009 - and remained \"friends with benefits\". She added that their relationship was \"almost non-existent\" between 2010 and his death. Epstein died by suicide in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. \"I do not believe he died by suicide, no,\" Maxwell said when asked, although she added that she did \"not have any reason\" to believe that he had been killed in a bid to silence him. \"It's ludicrous,\" she said of theories that he was murdered. \"I also happen to think if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail.\" \"And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would've been a very easy target,\" she added. Earlier this year, reports emerged that Trump had been told by US Attorney General Pam Bondi that his name appeared in the official files of the investigation into Epstein . Trump has never been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with the case - and on the campaign trail last year said he would publicise more information about the case. But he reversed his position several months into his administration, saying the case was closed, and criticised supporters and journalists who continued to press him on it."

        "title": "Why India's Election Commission is facing a test of credibility",
        "text": "India's Election Commission (ECI), one of the most trusted public institutions in the world's largest democracy, is facing a test of its credibility. Over the past few weeks, it has fielded a string of allegations from the opposition, ranging from voter fraud and manipulation to inconsistencies in electoral rolls. It has denied all of these. Opposition leaders, who have held massive protests against the ECI in recent days, said they were considering an impeachment motion to remove the chief election commissioner from his position. They hadn't filed the motion by Thursday, the last day of the monsoon session of parliament, and currently don't have the numbers to see it through. Meanwhile, Rahul Gandhi, the leader of India's main opposition party Congress, has launched a 16-day, 1,300km (807 miles) march - known as the Voter Adhikar Yatra (Voter Rights March) - in Bihar state to protest against the ECI, marking a dramatic escalation in the political fight. Bihar, set to vote in a key state election later this year, has been in the middle of a of electoral rolls. Gandhi first made the allegations of in August, accusing the ECI of colluding with the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to rig the 2024 general elections. Using granular data from the ECI's own records, he alleged that a parliamentary constituency in the southern state of Karnataka had more than 100,000 fake voters, including duplicate voters, invalid addresses and bulk registrations at single locations. The ECI has repeatedly called the claims \"false and misleading\". And the BJP has strongly denied these allegations, with leader Anurag Thakur the Congress and the opposition had come together to make these \"baseless claims\" because they were anticipating a loss in Bihar. Gandhi's press conference was held as the controversy in Bihar was raging. The Special Intensive Revision (SIR) happened between June and July, with the ECI saying its representatives visited all of Bihar's 78.9 million voters for verification. The ECI says this was done to update the voter lists after more than 20 years, but opposition leaders say the process may have disenfranchised tens of thousands of people, especially migrants, because of the haste with which it was conducted and the onerous documentation required as proof. After a draft of the updated list was published on 1 August, several reports, , highlighted errors in the count, such as the wrong gender and photos assigned against people's names, and dead voters on the rolls. The new draft rolls have 72.4 million names - 6.5 million fewer than before, with the commission saying the omissions include duplicate, deceased and migrant voters. Those who believe their names were wrongly struck off have been given until 1 September to appeal. Meanwhile, criticism also intensified over the manner in which the ECI published the names of the 6.5 million people that were excluded from the draft rolls. Opposition parties questioned why the commission was putting up scanned physical copies, rather than machine-readable lists of omitted voters, which could be independently verified by analysts and political parties. Eventually, India's top court told the ECI to publish a searchable list of voters and also state the reasons for their exclusion. The court's intervention highlighted the ECI's \"procedural failures\" and must be seen as a \"rap on the knuckles\", an in the leading Hindu newspaper said. Amid the mounting criticism, ECI held a rare weekend on17 August to address some of the allegations. \"If you use terms like vote theft and mislead citizens, then what else would you call this, other than an insult to India's constitution?\" Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said, referring to Gandhi's allegations. He cited a 2019 Supreme Court judgment to say the opposition's demand for machine-readable voter lists could impinge on people's privacy. He also demanded that Gandhi either give an affidavit under oath proving his allegations, or apologise to the nation for his remarks. But instead of putting the matter to rest, the statements sparked further outrage, with some opposition politicians accusing Kumar of either avoiding answering specific questions or providing unsatisfactory explanations. Pawan Khera of the Congress party told BBC Hindi that Kumar's \"adversarial tone\" at the press conference made it seem \"as if a BJP leader was speaking\". Experts say that on their own, the allegations by Gandhi, or the fact that millions of new voters have been added or removed from the rolls in Bihar, don't prove any wrongdoing. \"When the voter list is intensively verified, such large differences in numbers are bound to occur,\" former chief election commissioner N Gopalaswami told BBC Tamil. Mr Gopalaswami added that when the electoral roll for the southern state of Karnataka was revised in 2008, some 5.2 million voters were removed, with nearly one million people applying to be added again. He also agreed with the ECI's demand for a signed affidavit by Gandhi, saying that responding to allegations without a written complaint sets a bad precedent for the institution. But with Gandhi's voter rights march under way and the Bihar elections looming, the issue is unlikely to die down. \"Whatever the Election Commission says, the opposition will definitely make it an issue in the upcoming Bihar elections,\" senior journalist Smita Gupta told BBC Hindi. In the meantime, there are larger concerns at play about the impact of all of this on the public's trust in the ECI. \"The trust the ECI once commanded almost unquestioningly is now under greater public scrutiny,\" former chief election commissioner SY Quraishi wrote in the Indian Express newspaper. He added that while the \"procedural architecture for transparency in elections remains in place... the perception of impartiality is as important as its reality. Reinforcing this trust is as crucial as ensuring technical accuracy\". According to a survey published this month by Lokniti, a research programme at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), however, trust in the ECI has dropped sharply. The agency's chief Sanjay Kumar has been separately in the crosshairs of the ECI and the BJP after he issued an apology for sharing wrong data on voter turnout in the state of Maharashtra, but its findings in other states point to a rising trust deficit with the ECI. In all the six states surveyed by CSDS in 2025, the number of people who had no trust in the EC had risen sharply from 2019 - In Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, it rose from 11% to 31% in the period. This systematic erosion, Mr Kumar told news portal, \"should be a big worry\" for the commission. \"It is not only the trust of the opposition which has gone down, it is also the trust among the people that has come down. The data clearly indicates that,\" Mr Kumar said."

        "text": "A fire has been put out at a nuclear power plant in Russia's western Kursk region and air defences have shot down a Ukrainian drone, Russian officials have said. The drone detonated when it fell and damaged a transformer, but radiation levels were normal and there were no casualties, a post from the plant's account on messaging app Telegram said. It comes as Ukraine is celebrating its independence day on Sunday, which marks the country's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to show maximum restraint around nuclear facilities in the war. Ukraine has not commented on the Russian accusation regarding the nuclear site in Kursk, a region where Ukrainian troops briefly invaded in an unexpected military counteroffensive against the Russians last year. The UK government has announced that Ukrainian flags will appear above Downing Street on Sunday in recognition of the anniversary. UK Defence Secretary John Healey has said Britain is \"ramping up\" its support for Ukraine \"on this special day for the freedom and democracy of the Ukrainian people\". The Ministry of Defence has announced that British military experts will continue to train Ukrainian soldiers until at least the end of 2026, with an extension to Operation Interflex. Operation Interflex is the codename given to the UK Armed Forces' training programme, which has been created to develop and prepare Ukrainian recruits to fight their country's Russian invaders. On Saturday, Russia said its forces in eastern Ukraine seized two villages in the Donetsk region. Russian forces have been advancing very slowly, and at great cost, in eastern Ukraine and they now control about 20% of Ukraine's territory. A full-scale invasion of Ukraine was launched by Russia in 2022. There has been intense diplomacy over the war this month, with US President Donald Trump meeting his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on 15 August. The summit was billed as a vital step towards peace in Ukraine. However, despite both leaders claiming the talks were a success, Trump has since shown growing frustration publicly over the lack of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine. Trump has said he is considering either hitting Russia with further economic sanctions or walking away from peace talks. \"I'm going to make a decision as to what we do and it's going to be, it's going to be a very important decision, and that's whether or not it's massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both, or we do nothing and say it's your fight,\" Trump said on Friday. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has repeatedly called for an unconditional ceasefire and his European allies have also insisted on a halt in fighting. Zelensky has also accused Russia of \"doing everything it can\" to prevent a meeting with Putin to try to end the war. Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Putin was ready to meet Ukraine's leader \"when the agenda is ready for a summit, and this agenda is not ready at all\", accusing Zelensky of saying \"no to everything\"."

United Nations Command said about 30 North Korean troops crossed the heavily-fortified border between the north and south, Yonhap News Agency said. Pyongyang responded by accusing Seoul of a \"deliberate provocation\". South Korea and the United States have been conducting large-scale joint military exercises in the region since Monday. US President Donald Trump is due to meet South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung at a summit on Monday in Washington. The newly-elected South Korean president had . However, Kim's sister has since rebuffed efforts towards reconciliation made by Lee's government. Kim also earlier this month condemned the US and South Korea's joint military drills, describing them as \"most hostile and confrontational\". The North Korean leader vowed to speed up his aim to increase the country's stash of nuclear weapons. In January, a new intermediate-range ballistic missile tipped with a hypersonic warhead, which it said \"will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region\". Senior South Korean officials have raised concerns about North Korea receiving Russian missile technology in exchange for against Ukraine. Shin Wonsik, national security adviser for former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, said last year that Seoul had found Moscow provided missiles and other equipment to help reinforce the air defense network for Pyongyang, the capital. Whether the latest missiles fired by North Korea involved any Russian technology was unclear. North Korea is one of the world's most repressive totalitarian states, with Kim and his family ruling the nation for decades. South and North Korea have been divided since the Korean War ended in 1953. They did not sign a peace treaty and therefore have remained technically still at war ever since, although it has been years since either side shelled the other."

        "title": "Man who alleged hundreds were raped and buried in Indian temple town arrested",
        "text": "Police in India have arrested a man who recently alleged that he had been coerced into burying hundred of bodies of women who were raped before being murdered. His startling claims had thrown the tiny religious town of Dharmasthala in the southern state of Karnataka into turmoil. Home to the centuries-old temple to Manjunatha Swamy - an incarnation of Shiva from the Hindu holy trinity - the town attracts thousands of pilgrims daily and is central to the fabric of local people's lives. A political row in the state resulted in the government setting up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to verify the man's allegations. A SIT official who did not want to be named told the BBC on Saturday morning that the man \"has been arrested for perjury\". In early July, the middle-aged man had lodged a police complaint and appeared before a magistrate to record his statement. His identity has been withheld and, so far, he has appeared in public dressed fully in black, including a hood and a face mask. In the police complaint which the BBC has seen, the man said he worked as a cleaner at the temple from 1995 to 2014 - and alleged that he had been forced to bury the bodies of hundreds of girls and young women who were brutally raped and murdered. He narrated five alleged incidents where he gave specifics, and said there were many others. Some of the victims, the man alleged, were minors. He said he had been in hiding since 2014 and had returned and spoken up to silence his nagging conscience. The cleaner did not name anyone but blamed the \"temple administration and its staff\" - allegations . When he was taken to the magistrate, the man went on to produce a human skull from his bag as evidence. He said it belonged to a body he had buried and that he had retrieved it recently from the  spot. \"The skull and skeletal remains he produced are not brought from any spot in which he claimed to have buried the bodies,'' the SIT official said. Saturday's arrest comes as a major turn in a saga that has set off a firestorm within the state and outside. The allegations received intense media coverage. After concerns were raised by the state's women's commission, the government launched a major criminal investigation and set up the SIT. For the past several weeks, the team conducted excavations at locations in and around Dharmasthala to verify the man's claims. He had initially identified 13 spots - some of them in hard-to-reach areas covered by dense foliage and reportedly infested with venomous snakes. Sources in the SIT confirmed to the BBC that human remains, including a skull and nearly 100 bone fragments, have been found at two of the spots and had been sent for forensic testing. It is not clear who they belong to. The allegations also put the spotlight on the influential Heggade family - hereditary administrators of the temple. In a statement to the BBC, chief administrator Veerendra Heggade, an MP in the Indian parliament's upper house who received the country's second highest civilian award Padma Vibhushan in 2015, welcomed the SIT inquiry. The temple \"really appreciates the government for appointing the SIT for investigating the alleged unnatural deaths claimed to have occurred in and around Dharmasthala\", he wrote. \"We are already extending full support for the investigation. We have full faith on our judiciary and investigation agency and constitution of India,\" he added. In an with Indian news agency PTI later, he called the former cleaner's claims \"impossible\" and said that \"once and for all the truth should come out\". The allegations also resulted in a huge political row - the issue was discussed in the just-concluded session of the state assembly, with the opposition BJP members calling it a \"smear campaign\" against a Hindu religious site that has millions of devotees. Home Minister G Parameshwara from the state's governing Congress party said the government had no intention of either shielding anyone or maligning anyone. \"Shouldn't the truth come out?\" he asked. \"If nothing is found, Dharmasthala's stature will only grow stronger."

        "title": "My trip to North Korea's 'Benidorm' - flanked by guards and full of rules",
        "text": "It was the security guards accompanying Anastasia Samsonova's group that suggested this wasn't a typical beach holiday. In July, the 33-year-old human resources worker was one of the first tourists to stay at a new holiday resort in North Korea, a country largely closed to the outside world. Set in an exclusive area on the east coast where leader Kim Jong Un spent much of his youth, the Wonsan Kalma Coastal Tourist Zone opened on 1 July. Built near a missile testing site, the resort features hotels, restaurants, shopping malls and a water park, according to state media. But while it was initially billed as being open to international tourists, so far only Russians, entering in groups and organised by accredited travel agencies, have been allowed in. Anastasia travelled there last month with 14 other people. The visit was tightly controlled, with guides and guards accompanying them and a fixed itinerary that could not be diverged from without permission from North Korean authorities. She says the guides told her the guards were needed to \"prevent situations where we interacted with locals and startled them\". \"When we walked down the street, they [North Koreans] looked at us with great surprise because the country has been closed for a very long time,\" says Anastasia. BBC News Russian got in contact with her after searching the geotags of people on social media who had travelled to the resort, independently of any travel agency or media outlet. Anastasia says her group was also told not to photograph construction sites and was expected not to wear revealing clothes. Yet despite the restrictions, she says she \"enjoyed a vacation without people\" on almost-empty beaches with white sand. \"Every day the [beach] was cleaned and levelled perfectly. Everything was immaculate,\" she says. \"The loungers were absolutely new, everything spotless. The entrance to the sea was very gentle, so yes, it really was a very good beach.\" Since the Covid pandemic, international tourism into North Korea had been on pause to prevent the spread of the virus. But last year, the republic began allowing Russian tourists to visit again. In February, it also started receiving tourists from the West, including Australia, France, Germany and the UK, though it abruptly halted this weeks later, without saying why. Wonsan Kalma has been touted as a key part of Kim's ambitions to boost tourism in the country. It is said to have drawn inspiration from Spain's tourism hotspot Benidorm, where a North Korean delegation was sent on a fact-finding mission in 2017. But details of how it was built have been shrouded in secrecy, and human rights groups have criticised the alleged harsh treatment of workers. Weeks after it opened, North Korea announced that foreigners were \"temporarily\" not allowed to visit - except tourists from Russia, an ally of the republic. So far, two Russian tour groups have visited the resort, with another currently there. A week-long trip from Russia to North Korea, including three days at the Wonsan Kalma resort, costs $1,800 (£1,300) - 60% more than the average monthly salary in Russia. Some adverts for the trip even reference the nearby missile testing site, describing it as a \"unique\" vacation spot. Anastasia says no missiles were launched while she was there, but toy rockets were being sold nearby for $40 (£30). Describing a typical day while on her trip, Anastasia says the group would have breakfast at 08:00 when lots of activities were planned and 09:30 on a more relaxed day. In terms of the food they were given, there was \"lots of meat\", typically in sweet and sour sauce, and a dish involving finely-chopped cabbage and carrots in sauce. She says a 500ml bottle of beer was very cheap, costing about 60 cents at the beach, while the souvenir of choice for tourists was North Korean Olympic clothing. Another tourist, Daria, writing on Instagram, described the resort as \"very raw\" and \"not the kind of vacation Russian tourists are used to\". \"But if you're tired of Asia, Turkey, etc., and want something exotic — this is it,\" she added. However, there is uncertainty over when the next Russian tourists will be allowed into Wonsan Kalma. The travel agency which organised the first three trips to the resort, Vostok Intur, said there was high interest in potential tours in September, but North Korean authorities had yet to agree to them. Initially, tours were advertised online by Russian travel agencies for mid-September, but these were later removed. It is not just Russians who face difficulties getting to Wonsan Kalma. Even citizens of China, which borders North Korea and is its main ally and economic partner, are having difficulties accessing the resort, according to Andrei Lankov, an expert in North Korea-Russia relations and a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul. He says Pyongyang deliberately limits the number of tourists and closely controls their movements, in part so North Koreans won't compare themselves unfavourably to richer foreigners. \"Ordinary people might begin to wonder, 'How is it that even without our great leader, or his son or daughter, they seem to live so well?'\", Lankov says. For that reason, North Korea has concluded it's largely better not to have too many foreigners entering the country, he adds. With travel restrictions into North Korea easing, tourism from Russia has been rising, though it remains modest compared with other destinations. In 2024, about 1,500 Russians travelled to North Korea for tourism, according to Russia's Federal Security Service border guards. In contrast, more than 6.7 million visited Turkey and almost 1.9 million went to China. However, in the second quarter of 2025, 1,673 Russians entered North Korea as tourists – a level last seen in 2010, before tourist restrictions were introduced. Wonsan Kalma is seen as key to reviving North Korea's ailing economic fortunes, but it's not been without controversy. Since the resort began construction in 2018, human rights groups have protested the alleged mistreatment of its workers. They point to reports of people being forced to work long hours to finish the massive project under harsh conditions and inadequate compensation. The BBC has approached the North Korean embassy in London for comment. Despite the challenges of getting to Wonsan Kalma, and the restrictions on what Russian tourists can do when they arrive in North Korea, Anastasia says she hopes to come back next year. \"We're actually thinking about gathering the whole group next year to go to the same place. \"I'm not sure if it will work out, but I've heard there's also a ski resort near Wonsan Kalma. So, maybe one day I'll visit that resort too.\""

        "title": "Trump's plan to send troops to Chicago is abuse of power, Illinois governor says",
        "text": "President Donald Trump's plan to deploy troops to Chicago is an abuse of power, the Democratic governor of the US state of Illinois has said. There is no emergency that justifies the National Guard being sent to Illinois and the US president is \"attempting to manufacture a crisis\", JB Pritzker said in a statement. Trump has already deployed about 2,000 troops to Washington DC, where the local government is also run by opposition Democrats, as part of what he is portraying as a crackdown on crime in US cities. On Friday, Trump said he would implement the policy in Chicago and New York - two other major Democrat-controlled cities. Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson responded to Trump's comments, saying in a statement that he has not received any information about the deployment of the National Guard in Chicago. He has said the city government has \"grave concerns\" about any deployment of troops, labelling the president's approach as \"uncoordinated, uncalled for, and unsound\". Johnson added that the \"unlawful deployment\" could \"inflame tensions between residents and law enforcement\", and threaten the progress the city has made in reducing crime. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the National Guard personnel patrolling the streets of Washington DC to be armed, as part of the Trump administration's efforts against what they have described as \"out of control\" crime in the city. Just last week, the Pentagon and US Army said that troops involved in the deployment - which now number approximately 2,000 - would not carry weapons. While the Trump administration has lauded the mission, polls show it is deeply unpopular with many residents in staunchly Democratic Washington. In a statement, the Pentagon said that National Guard troops \"will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training\". It is unclear if the decision to arm the troops will mean that their mission in Washington is changing. So far, troops have not taken part in law enforcement operations - which have been carried out by local police and officers from various federal agencies - and have instead been posted near local landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station, the capital's primary passenger rail transportation hub. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser has so far not commented on the decision. Speaking in the White House Oval Office on Friday, Trump said that the mission has brought \"total safety\" to Washington - and that the mission could be expanded to Chicago - a city where the leadership has sometimes found itself at odds with the Trump administration. \"DC was a hellhole,\" he said earlier on Friday, a day after visiting some of the deployed troops. \"But now it's safe.\" As many as 1,700 National Guardsmen are expected to mobilise in 19 states in the coming weeks, US media report. Of the states expecting a National Guard presence, Texas will have the most troops. The guardsmen will reportedly support Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) efforts and serve as a visible deterrent. Despite declaring the Washington DC mission a success, Trump said that he is considering declaring a national emergency once the deployment's 30-day deadline expires. \"If I think we're in great shape here, that's one thing. But if I don't, I'm just going to say it's a national emergency,\" he said. \"If I have a national emergency, I can keep the troops here as long as I want.\" Several Republican-led states, including South Carolina and West Virginia, have also contributed forces to the crackdown. Additionally, Trump said he would ask Congress for $2bn (£1.48bn) to help beautify the city. Earlier this year, the Republican-controlled Congress passed legislation that saw Washington's budget cut by a total of $1.1bn. In a post on X on Friday morning, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the operation had so far netted more than 700 arrests - including 40 on Thursday - and seized 91 illegal firearms. Local officials have questioned the need for federal intervention in the city, with Mayor Bowser pointing to a \"huge decrease in crime\" that she claimed was at a \"30-year violent crime low\". A poll conducted by the Washington Post and Schar School released earlier this week found the deployment deeply unpopular among the city's residents, with almost 80% saying they are opposed to both the deployment of federal officers and the National Guard, as well as the takeover of the Metropolitan Police Department."
